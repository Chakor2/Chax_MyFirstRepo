# Overview of Admin Console

The Admin Console enables the Hitachi Cloud Accelerator Platform administrators to manage a common set of groups and users for the following accelerators:

- Hitachi Cloud Accelerator Platform - Deploy (Deploy Accelerator)
- Hitachi Cloud Accelerator Platform - Assess (Assess Accelerator)
- Hitachi Cloud Accelerator Platform - Test (Test Accelerator)
- Hitachi Cloud Accelerator Platform - Workflow (Workflow Accelerator)
- Hitachi Cloud Accelerator Platform - Observe (Observe Accelerator)

Each user is assigned to one or more groups. The administrators assign permissions to each group by either selecting policies or configuring share permissions for specific resources. Based on their assigned groups, users can perform different actions in Deploy Accelerator, Assess Accelerator, Test Accelerator, Workflow Accelerator, and Observe Accelerator.

Administrators can use the Admin Console to add [groups](../admin-console/groups.md) and [users](../admin-console/users.md) and assign users to appropriate groups. If required, administrators can modify users or groups, disable users, and delete groups. Administrators can also [integrate Cloud Accelerator Platform with an existing setup of Active Directory](../admin-console/activeDir.md) and manage users and group membership in Active Directory.

> **Note:** When Cloud Accelerator Platform is successfully deployed, a default administrator is created with the credentials mentioned in the **customer.yml** file at the time of deployment. If required, this administrator can create additional administrators.
